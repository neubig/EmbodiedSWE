"""Boot the REGISTERED preset from the extracted tree — and harvest describe().

One headless sim launch proves the code closure AND the asset closure (a
missing USD only surfaces at env-build time), validates the actual baked
preset the agent will face, and captures a sectioned markdown description
(scene / robot, from the live objects) for the prompt.
Principle: no bundle ships unbooted.
