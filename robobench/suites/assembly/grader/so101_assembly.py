"""Grader for the so101 scene: the elbow servo seated + tab-screwed into the upper arm, the forearm
clipped onto its horn + horn-screwed.

The scene defines no `success()`; the criterion below is read off its own assembly geometry
and fastening state (see `check_success`):
    every loose screw fastened — the four identical M2 tab screws in the four tab holes and the
    eight identical M3 horn screws in the eight horn-line holes (the scene's own `state == 2`,
    "fully fastened") — with the servo live in the arm pocket and the forearm live on the horn.

Rubric stages (weights and modes live in RUBRIC):
    motor_seated          the bare servo sits in the upper arm's pocket: its body frame on the
                          upper_arm link frame (identical by construction when seated) within the
                          scene's fastening-gate tolerances `motor_align_pos` / `motor_align_deg`
                          — the scene's own PARTS ALIGNED rule for the tab holes
    tab_screws_picked     fraction of the four identical M2 tab screws ever carried on the drill's
                          magnetic bit (`attached`, the scene's only "grasp" of a screw; a
                          fastened screw was necessarily driven off that bit) — a milestone
    tab_screws_fastened   fraction of the four M2s welded home in a tab hole (`fastened`)
    fork_seated           the forearm's clevis sits on the servo's output horn: the lower_arm at
                          the elbow-joint seat transform of the motor, within the same
                          `motor_align_pos` / `motor_align_deg` gate, angle-agnostic about the
                          horn axis (the assembled elbow may stand at any angle) — the scene's
                          PARTS ALIGNED rule for the horn holes
    horn_screws_picked    fraction of the eight identical M3 horn screws ever carried on the bit
    horn_screws_fastened  fraction of the eight M3s welded home in a horn-line hole
Every stage is per env. The two "picked" milestones are the grasped rung of the screws' ladder;
the servo and the forearm have no grasp the scene can measure (no grasp contract, no lift
threshold in cfg), so their ladders start at the seated rung. A screw's transient "in the hole,
not yet home" state is not a rung: the auto-driver takes it from engaged to fastened by itself.
