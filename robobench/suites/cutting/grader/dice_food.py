"""Grader for the dice scene: the food diced into its target number of pieces, all still on the board.

Rubric stages (weights and modes live in RUBRIC):
    knife_taken  the knife has been lifted off its rest — its root raised by the rest's rail
                 height (`cfg.rest_rail_h`), the lift that frees the plate from the notches; a
                 milestone, credit kept after the knife is put down
    pairs_cut    fraction of the grid's weld PAIRS released (`scene.pair_cut`, the dice gate's
                 own truth). The x-planes and y-planes are identical sub-goals — one stage, one
                 fraction, each pair worth the same
    diced        the scene's own done test: connected components of the live weld graph reach
                 the target piece count AND every piece is still on the board (footprint from
                 `cfg.board_size`, resting above the board top). "On the board" is a GATE on
                 this stage, not a stage of its own — it is true at reset and only means
                 anything once the food is diced
Success = `diced` read on the final state.
