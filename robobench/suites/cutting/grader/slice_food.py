"""Grader for the slice scene: the food cut into its target number of pieces, all still on the board.

Rubric stages (weights and modes live in RUBRIC):
    knife_taken  the knife has been lifted clear of its rest — its root raised by at least
                 cfg.rest_rail_h (the rails' height) above where it lay at the graded reset, so
                 the edge is above the rail tops and the notches no longer hold it; a milestone
                 ("once"), credit kept after the knife is set down again
    planes_cut   fraction of the cuts the target needs that have been made — released planes
                 over (target - 1), a linear ramp from the welded food (0) to the target piece
                 count (1), target = cfg.target_pieces or every piece. The scored planes are
                 identical sub-goals: one stage, one fraction, each plane worth the same
    sliced       the scene's own done test: piece count (connected components of the live weld
                 chain, `pieces_count()`) reaches the target AND every piece is still on the
                 chopping board — inside the board's footprint (cfg.board_size) and above its
                 top. "On the board" is a GATE on this stage, not a stage of its own: it is
                 true at reset and only means anything once the food is cut
Success = `sliced` read when the delivery finishes.
