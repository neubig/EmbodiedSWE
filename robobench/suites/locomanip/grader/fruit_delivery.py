"""Grader for the fruit delivery scene: every fruit carried around the table and set on the far plate.

Rubric stages (weights and modes live in RUBRIC), each a fraction over the fruits PRESENT this
episode (the scene's `present` mask; identical fruits share one stage):
    lifted   fraction of fruits ever raised clear of the table — the fruit's origin (the produce
             assets sit with their origin at the base, on `cfg.surface_z`) above the plate's rim
             height (`cfg.plate_rim_z`), the height every fruit must clear to enter the dish; a
             milestone, credit kept after the fruit is set down
    carried  mean transit progress: for each fruit, a linear ramp of its radial xy distance from
             the plate's counted centre (the scene's own body-frame measure, see `_on_plate`) from
             where it lay at the graded reset (0) to the counted footprint edge
             `cfg.radius_frac * cfg.plate_radius` (1); a milestone, so a fruit that arrives and is
             released keeps the credit
    placed   the scene's own `fruits_placed()` — on the plate AND settled — as a fraction of the
             present fruits, GATED by the scene's `nonfruits_on_plate()` being empty: a pumpkin or
             onion on the plate fails the task, so it zeroes the done stage rather than being a
             weighted stage of its own (it is trivially "true" at reset)
Success is the scene's own `success()`: every present fruit placed and nothing that is not a fruit
on the plate, read on the final state.
