"""LocoPolicyController — legs driven by a FROZEN locomotion policy, commanded by base velocity.

The loco half of loco-manipulation. The action is not a joint target and not an end-effector pose:
it is a **base command** `[vx, vy, wz, hip_height]` — where the robot should go, not how to move its
legs — and a frozen neural policy turns that into position targets for the 12 leg DOFs, closing the
balance loop at the control rate. Everything above the pelvis is somebody else's controller; this is
a leaf, and `composite` is what makes the pair one robot (its docstring has named this case from the
start: "loco-manip = arms by IK **+** legs by a frozen policy").

    action = [vx, vy, wz, hip_height]      (m/s, m/s, rad/s, m — in the robot's own base frame)
      -> policy([command(4) | observation(79)])  -> 12 raw leg residuals
      -> target = 0.25 * residual + default_joint_pos[legs]

THE POLICY. The shipped default is NVIDIA's **AGILE** G1 checkpoint, vendored at
`robots/assets/g1/policies/agile_locomotion.pt` (see `robots/assets/fetch_g1_locomotion.py` for
provenance and the measured 4+79 -> 12 signature). It is TorchScript, stateless and deterministic —
the only memory in the loop is the `last_action` term, which this controller owns and feeds back.
Nothing here is G1-specific except the defaults the robot passes in: `policy_path`, the joint
regexes and the observation spec are all cfg, so another embodiment's checkpoint — or a HOMIE /
self-trained one — is a config swap, not a code change.

THE OBSERVATION IS A CONTRACT WITH THE CHECKPOINT. All 79 numbers, in this order, are Isaac Lab's
`AgileTeacherPolicyObservationsCfg` (`isaaclab_tasks/manager_based/locomanipulation/pick_place/
configs/agile_locomotion_observation_cfg.py`), reproduced here straight off `articulation.data` so
robobench owes nothing to isaaclab's manager stack:

    base_lin_vel        3    root_lin_vel_b          (pelvis frame)
    base_ang_vel        3    root_ang_vel_b
    projected_gravity   3    projected_gravity_b
    joint_pos          29    joint_pos - default_joint_pos      over the 29 body joints
    joint_vel          29    (joint_vel - default_joint_vel) * 0.1
    last_action        12    the PREVIOUS tick's RAW policy output (pre-scale, pre-offset)

Two ordering facts that will silently wreck the gait if you get them wrong — a mismatched
observation does not raise anywhere, the robot just twitches and falls over:

  - The 29 body joints are **articulation DOF order**, not regex order. Isaac resolves observation
    joints through `SceneEntityCfg` with `preserve_order=False`, i.e. sorted by joint index; robobench's
    `find_joints` defaults to the same. Every joint but the 14 hand DOFs is in there.
  - `last_action` is the policy's **raw** output (`AgileBasedLowerBodyAction._raw_actions`), before
    `output_scale` and before the default-pose offset. Feeding back the scaled target instead is a
    plausible-looking bug that just degrades the gait.

`bind` asserts the resolved joint counts and the policy's input width against each other, so a
re-vendored checkpoint or a re-authored USD fails loudly at build instead of at the first step.

MEASURED TRACKING (G1 + the vendored AGILE checkpoint, 4 s per trial from a settled stand on flat
ground, hip_height 0.72; achieved rates in the robot's own start frame). The command is a REQUEST,
not a guarantee — a solver must close its loop on the measured base pose, never dead-reckon:

    cmd (vx, vy, wz)   achieved (vx, vy, wz)        note
    (0.20, 0,    0)    (+0.155, +0.005, +0.013)     78 % of command

    (0.60, 0,    0)    (+0.543, -0.016, -0.019)     91 %
    (-0.30, 0,   0)    (-0.256, -0.011, +0.009)     85 %, backward walking works
    (0, 0.20,    0)    (+0.004, +0.151, +0.008)     76 %, strafing works
    (0, 0.40,    0)    (+0.009, +0.377, -0.018)     94 %
    (0, 0,    0.20)    (+0.000, +0.003, +0.019)     10 %  <-- see below
    (0, 0,    0.35)    (+0.001, +0.006, +0.035)     10 %  <--
    (0, 0,    0.50)    (+0.003, +0.008, +0.041)      8 %  <--
    (0, 0,   -0.50)    (-0.000, -0.010, -0.072)     14 %  <--
    (0.30, 0, 0.30)    (+0.194, +0.161, +0.362)     121 % on yaw, walking an arc

  - Translation tracks well in every direction and the axes barely cross-couple, so `vx`/`vy` are
    the reliable way to move the base. Under-tracking grows as the command shrinks (a 0.2 command
    is the weakest), so prefer a moderate command over a timid one.
  - **Turn-in-place barely turns.** From a standing start, a pure `wz` yields under a sixth of what
    is asked. Add forward speed and yaw tracks fully — the last row turns faster than commanded.
    This is a WALKING policy: it steers while stepping and has almost no pivot gait. Plan turns as
    arcs, or sidestep with `vy` instead of turning at all.
  - Pelvis height held 0.722-0.728 m against a 0.72 command through every trial, including transit.

Heavy imports (torch / isaaclab) are deferred so importing this module — and registering the
controller — stays app-free.
